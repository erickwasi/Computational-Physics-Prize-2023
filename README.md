Modelling the climate of an Earth-like planet in Python

Tasked with modelling the climate of an earth-like planet in Python. Produced a 24 page LaTeX paper detailing my work to produce a project, the results of which at the time were within a +- 25% range of expected results, but having fixed a small error are now within +- 5% of expected results.

"Your project was well explained and motivated and of an impressive level of sophistication for someone in E block. You also made a good attempt at analysing your output. There were a couple of slips, but overall you created a working model that gave some interesting output that would withstand further investigation. Your source referencing was also a great plus point!"
